You have this {db_type} database schema:
{db_schema}

Using only the tables and columns in that schema, generate **5 distinct** natural-language questions (no SQL).
Group them by complexity:
  - 1 basic (simple SELECT from a single table, no JOINs)
  - 2 medium (one JOIN, simple WHERE or aggregation)
  - 2 complex (multiple JOINs, subqueries, GROUP BY/HAVING or window functions)

Requirements:
- Questions must be clear and specific
- Use realistic business scenarios
- Questions should be answerable with the given schema
- Avoid questions that require data not in the schema

Only output the questions, in this format (no SQL, no markdown, no numbering):
QUESTION: <your NL question here>
