You are a SQL expert tasked with determining if two SQL queries are functionally equivalent.

Natural Language Question: {nl_question}

Query 1:
{original_sql}

Query 2:
{generated_sql}

Database Type: {db_type}

Instructions:

1.Analyze both queries carefully.
2.Consider the intent of the natural language question.
3.Check if both queries would return the exact same results for any given state of the database.
4.Account for different SQL syntax that achieves the same logical result (e.g., different JOIN syntax, equivalent WHERE clauses).
5.Consider database-specific functions and their equivalents.

Determine if these queries are functionally equivalent.

Respond with ONLY one of these three words:
"yes" - if the queries are functionally equivalent.
"no" - if the queries are NOT functionally equivalent.
"ambiguous" - if you cannot determine equivalence with certainty.

Do not provide any explanations, just the single word answer.
